## How to Install

✅ Clone repo

✅ By default the commits shown are from this repository (https://github.com/fede-tech/github-commit-history)

In order to get the commits from a different repo both githubUser and githubRepo constants should be replaced in src/config/github.ts

✅ Run npm install

✅ Run npm run dev
